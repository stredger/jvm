could do

{ 0Xbf, "athrow",       "", "A>" },     /* throw an error or exception (notice that the rest of the stack is cleared, leaving only a reference to the Throwable) */

{ 0Xc5, "multianewarray", "iii", "I*>A" }, /* create a new array of i3 dimensions with elements of type identified by class reference in constant pool index (i1 << 8 + i2); the sizes of each dimension is identified by count1, [count2, etc.] */
