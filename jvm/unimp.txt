Q's?
when you pop do you always or do you just go until at base?
compare refs use N or just make N an A?

 TODO's
Huge num of string mem leaks
push / pop functions
add verification and vbit to see if all inline instructions present n' shit
update instruction should check if last instruction for "falling off end"
fix dups
aastore???


could do



{ 0Xaa, "tableswitch",  "4+", "I>" },   /* continue execution from an address in the table at offset index */
{ 0Xab, "lookupswitch", "4+", "I>" },   /* a target address is looked up from a table using a key and execution continues from the instruction at that address */

{ 0Xbf, "athrow",       "", "A>" },     /* throw an error or exception (notice that the rest of the stack is cleared, leaving only a reference to the Throwable) */

{ 0Xc4, "wide",         "3+", "" },     /* execute opcode, where opcode is either iload, fload, aload, lload, dload, istore, fstore, astore, lstore, dstore, or ret, but assume the index is 16 bit; or execute iinc, where the index is 16 bits and the constant to increment by is a signed 16 bit short */

{ 0Xc5, "multianewarray", "iii", "I*>A" }, /* create a new array of i3 dimensions with elements of type identified by class reference in constant pool index (i1 << 8 + i2); the sizes of each dimension is identified by count1, [count2, etc.] */
